# Rockauth Angular

For development, you can link to the directory by executing the command:
```
bower link
```
inside the root of the rockauth-angular directory.
Then, inside the root of your app, use the command:
```
bower link rockauth-angular
```

This will create a sym-link inside the bower_components directory.
